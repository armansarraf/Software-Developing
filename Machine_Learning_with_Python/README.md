Project 1: CNN Classification for Face Recognition Dogs Vs Cats with 99% Accuracy
##
Project 2: The goal of this project is to become familiar with the scikit-learn library.
* We practice loading example datasets, perform classification and regression with multiple scikit-learn models, and compare results between using all features and two principal components as features.
* We answer to four key questions based on the result we get from this project.

Questions
1. For each task (classification and regression), which model performs best on the validation data using all features?
2. For each task (classification and regression), which model performs best on the validation data using two principal components?
3. In each task (classification and regression), for each model, how do full feature and two principal component model scores compare on the validation data?
4. Do any of the models underfit or overfit? Provide examples.
