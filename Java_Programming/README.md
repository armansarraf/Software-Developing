## Java
### Project 1: Calculating Temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius
* Implementing a class for a Temperature object that is capable of reporting its temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius.
##
### Project 2: Implementing a basic Tile game to Compare primitive types
* Designing and implementing a class for a Tile object that represents Scrabble tiles and compares primitive types.
##
### Project 3: Calculating Interest at a Given Rate for an Initial Principal Over a Fixed Number of Years (CLI)
* Designing a command-line user interface that lets the user input principal, interest rate, and years, and reports the CD’s maturity value with both yearly and daily compounding.
##
### Project 4: Showing the Number of Days in Each Month (GUI)
* Implementing a Java graphical user interface that prompts the user to enter a number which represents a month of the year, and reports whether that month contains 28, 30, or 31 days.
##
### Project 5: Implementing Newton Square Root (CLI)
* The user, input a number N, a maximum error that determines the difference between two consecutive Newton computations, and the user's initial guess. 
* Then, it calculates the square root using Newton's method and reports both the square root and the number of guesses required to calculate it.
##
### Project 6: Basic Hangman Game (GUI)
* A secret word is shown in masked form. Each time the user makes a guess, the GUI reports whether the guess is correct or not and displays the updated version of the secret word.
##
### Project 7: Sorting, Calculating Mean, and Median of an Array (GUI)
* The GUI contains an input JTextField, an output JTextArea, and two JButtons. 
* The user is prompted to enter numbers into the JTextField. Pressing ENTER will add the number. 
* When the STATS button is clicked, the program sorts and displays the numbers that were entered, plus their mean and median. 
* When the RESET button is clicked, the GUI is cleared so that a new set of stats may be calculated.
##
### Project 8: Implementing Polymorphism and Abstarct
* Implementing and modifying the Animal class, using subclass of Animal (Cow, Cat, and Pig), implementing interfaces and Abstract method.
##
### Project 9: The objective of this project is to read a given text file and analyze its:
* Number of words , special characters, numbers and all the characters
* Number of repeated words and repeated characters including special characters
* Locating consecutively repeated words and characters. What words and what characters are repeated
* Adding a quotation mark before and after a number (i.e. 1 => "1" or 342 => "342")
* Get two key words from a user and replace the first one by second one and add 'ZZ' before and after the updated word

##
### Project 11: Tic-Tac-Toe game (console-based) from a given class diagram
* Impplementing a Tic-Tac console-based game following the given class diagram.
##
### Project 12: GUI-based student course registration application in MVC format
* 1. Search catalogue courses
* 2. Add course to student courses
* 3. Remove course from student courses
* 4. View All courses in catalogue
* 5. View all courses taken by student
* 6. Quit
##
### Project 13: Auto increament counter between synchronized threads with socket programming
* Whenever two or more threads (or processes) share a variable (or data area), any computation on the shared variable by one thread must be protected from interference by the other threads. Only by careful analysis can we identify these critical regions and then use a synchronization primitive to protect them. In Java, this synchronization primitive is a Hoare-style monitor associated with the object. The monitor guarantees that at most one thread can execute within a critical region for that object at any time.
##
### Project 14: Palindrome checking for client input in server side
* 1. Client prompts the user to enter a word
* 2. Then, it passes the string to the server.
* 3. The server is supposed to examine the string and send a message to the server indicating whether the user input is a palindrome or not.
##
### Project 15: Tic-Tac-Toe console-based with Thread pool
* 1. it can support multiple games simultaneously.
* 2. Each game will have its own thread and the communication between players is managed via sockets.
* 3. Each player has to wait for their opponent to continue the game
##
### Project 16: A string manipulation GUI-based app using thread pool and supporting different clients
* 1. Application follows a client-server architecture.
* 2. The clients and server only communicate through sockets.
* 3. Application is available to multiple clients at once.
* 4. Application follows the MVC design pattern.

### Project 17: A Movie Theater Ticket Reservation App (GUI)
In this project task is to analyze, design, and develop a system that can be used by two
group of users: ordinary users that can search for a movie, select an specific theater, view
available show times, view graphically available seats, select the desired seat, make payment by
credit card, receive a copy of ticket and the receipt, via email. Users also should be able to cancel
their ticket only up to 72 hours prior to show and receive a credit with %15 administration fee for
future purchase up maximum of one-year expiration date. The other group of users are those who
must be registered (let’s call them Registered Users, RUs), and their information such as name,
address, credit and/or debit card account must be saved on the system’s database. RUs must pay
a $20.00 annual account fee, but they don't have to pay 15% admin fee for cancelling their
tickets and will receive the movie news before public announcement. There is also one more
constraint: Only 10% of the seats can be purchased by RUs on a first come first serve policy
prior to public announcements.
