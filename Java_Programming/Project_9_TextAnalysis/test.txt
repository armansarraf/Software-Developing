The emergence of machine learning in the artificial intelligence 
field led the world of technology to make great strides.
Today’s advanced systems with the ability of being designed just like human brain
 functions has given practitioners 
the ability totrain systems so that they could process, analyze, 
classify, and predict different data classes. 
Therefore, the machine learning field has become a hot topic for scientists and 
researchers to introduce the best network with the highest performance for such
 mentioned purposes. In this article, computer vision science, image classificat
ion implementation, and deep neural networks are presented. 
This article discusses how models have been designed based on the concept of the
 human brain. 
The development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and its various arch
itectures, which have shown great efficiency and evaluation in object detection,
 face recognition, image classification, and localization, are also introduced. 
Furthermore, the utilization and application of CNNs, including voice recogni
tion, image processing, video processing, and text recognition, are examined closely. 
A literature review is conducted to illustrate the significance and the deta
ils of Convolutional Neural Networks in various applications.
CNN : 
The most famous architecture is Convolutional Neural Network, the so-called CNN [4]. 
Convolutional neural networks can be considered as a class of Deep Neural Network. 
A convolutional neural network has several layers, each with a specific function in processing. 
This network has shown so much efficiency that large companies such as Google
, Facebook, and AT&T hired uncountable scientists to design and introduce the
 best architectures that can be implemented in CNNs. In this section, compone
nts and the best architectures of CNNs are reviewed [5]. 
After using different applications, the research resulted in satisfactory pe
rformance for solving problems, overcoming human error.
